# SuperCollider Examples

SuperCollider is an environment and programming language originally released in 1996 by James McCartney for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

It is free and open-source, and by sharing these examples, I hope to also share the software with more interested individiuals.

The aim of this repo is to share tools for audio design, processing, and composition.
I also aim to further develop my audio engineering and algorithmic compositional skills through this language.
The files within range from code examples (.scd), necessary audio samples (.wav), to implementations for midi-enabled devices, and more.
Eventually, I hope to include examples of additional "Unit Generators", or add-on plugins written in C++, as well as implementations for AU/VST plugins in traditional DAWs.
